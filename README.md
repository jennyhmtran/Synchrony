Files:
index.html - main HTML page. Serve with browser that supports html (ex. Chrome)
app.js - Loops through json file for image information and formats each gallery image box
filter-gallery.js - implements "all" filter to retrieve all images
e-search.js - implements search functionality using image title/partial keyword
imageinfo.json - main json that provides image information


Instructions:
Load index.html in a browser that supports html (ex. Chrome) using localhost
Can be used with a different json file as long as naming structure/schema are consistent.

Comment:
Original json file had broken image links. I removed those to prevent blank images from being displayed.
Very cool project. I have learned a tremendous amount from tinkering around different Jquery plugins and seeing what works and what doesn't.
